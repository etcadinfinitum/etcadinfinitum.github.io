<p>I work in UW Bothell’s CSS IT department as a Linux Lab technician. </p>

<p>
My job description could be interpreted as simple maintenance, but the team I work on is given the opportunity to find elegant solutions that improve the services provided by the lab. 
To that end, I create solutions and diagnostic tools to the I work hard to understand the benefits and limitations of the lab’s infrastructure.
