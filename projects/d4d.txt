<p>Let's build something amazing for the public good!</p>
<p>This is a relatively new (ad)venture, but the potential impact is absolutely thrilling. 
Lizzy intends to focus on the <a href="http://http://datafordemocracy.org/projects/drug-spending.html" 
target="_blank">prescription spending</a> project, since her background in ancillary testing services 
and the financial burden upon patients for non-essential services provides some context of the significance 
of the potential impact of well-examined data sets in this field.</p>
