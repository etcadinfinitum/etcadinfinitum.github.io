# Stories and Musings

A project blog about technology, education, games, and other diversions. 

Hosted at <https://lizzy.wiki/>.

The site is made with the following resources and Jekyll modules:
* Basic theme by [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Heavy modifications 
  on theme structure and page organization by Lizzy. Poole and Hyde themes 
  were refactored into separate [`structure`](./_includes/structure.css) 
  and [`text`](./_includes/text.css) stylesheets for readability and 
  conciseness.
* Theme customization (colors, fonts) by Lizzy.
* Tag browsing by [Long Quian](https://github.com/qian256/qian256.github.io), 
  with no discernable modifications.
* [Image gallery](./_includes/gallery.html) based on this 
  [example](https://jekyllcodex.org/without-plugin/image-gallery/#) from 
  the Jekyll Codex, with heavy modifications by Lizzy.
