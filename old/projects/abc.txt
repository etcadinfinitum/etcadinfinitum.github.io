<p>I was offered an internship spot for Summer 2018 with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abclegal.com/">ABC Legal Services</a> as part of their software development team.</p>
<p>As an intern, I was tasked with creating new automation solutions for document e-filing, a value-added service ABC provides for its many clients. The main project I implemented during the summer was an e-filing solution for Illinois county courts, which represents a large share of the business the company receives in IL and adds value and selling points to continue building the company's market in that state.</p>
<p>Skills & tools summary:
<ul>
    <li>Utilizing the Selenium framework for Python to navigate the e-filing vendor's portal and web form.</li>
    <li>Spearheading the centralization of automation processes in the cloud and assisting other team members with the migration process.</li>
    <li>Creating headless automation solutions and deploying them to a virtual Linux box in AWS (with invocations in bash via crontab).</li>
    <li>Working with ABC's operations team to understand customer and vendor requirements, and implementing the services to meet these needs.</li>
    <li>Coordinating development with other team members to maximize the effectiveness of other automated systems and cloud deployment.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I have been invited to continue creating solutions for the development team into the coming school year, and I am excited to continue learning and working with the amazing development team here! I hope to accomplish the following:
<ul>
    <li>Continue to refine and streamline automation processes</li>
    <li>Break out into new services which will provide important research tools for ABC operations employees and company clients</li>
    <li>Contribute to ABC's proprietary production software (a Java-based application with web and Android integration</li>
</ul>
Stay tuned for more updates!
