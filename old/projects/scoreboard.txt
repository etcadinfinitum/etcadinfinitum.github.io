<p>As an incoming UW Bothell student, I am super excited to work with the CS-oriented clubs and groups! For cybersecurity club <a target="_blank" href="https://grayhats.io/">Gray Hats</a>, a web application for scoring Capture The Flag events is a valuable addition to the group's tools and resources. I am super excited to be spearheading the development for this project!
</p>
<p>The project requires the following services:
<ul>
    <li>Real-time displays of active and compromised services for individual teams, along with graphs of historical trends for the competition session. The data will be generated via API calls with their competition server, and graphing will be done with an online-friendly module.</li>
    <li>User authentication for scoreboard access, with varying access tiers and persisted competition history.</li>
    <li>Technology stack (subject to change): Flask, matplotlib/pygal/plotly, bcrypt, AJAX, HTML/CSS/JS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing this deployed in the fall!</p>
