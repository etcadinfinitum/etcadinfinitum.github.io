<p>Thank you for stopping by to learn a little bit more about Lizzy Presland, the mastermind behind this little corner of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Lizzy is a software engineer who strives to marry aesthetics and functionality for the Every (wo)Man. 
Before she embarked on the strange and wonderful journey into software design and mechanics, she spent several
 (too many) years experiencing enterprise software as a non-technical user in a variety of roles, including project 
management, accounting & finance, and customer service. As a result of her early experiences as a white-collar 
corporate drone, she admires platforms with multi-disciplinary approaches to UX design. </p>
<p>As a budding SWE, Lizzy hopes to bring intuitive, elegant, and customizable user experiences to enterprise systems,
 and to make data-driven intelligence more accessible to non-technical users. She is particularly fascinated by 
emerging machine learning techniques that can and will enable people to make critically important decisions. In this 
ever-changing world, resource management is becoming more crucial than ever to the success of the global community. 
Lizzy hopes her contributions in the field will help humanity face the daunting challenges ahead with respect to 
climate change and challenges in health care access and optimization for an ever-growing population.</p>
<p>Lizzy's goals and interests may be lofty, but her immediate pursuits are quite concrete. She is currently 
completing college credits as a pre-cursor to pursing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, and will be starting 
her junior-level coursework in Fall 2018. In the meantime, her extra-curricular pursuits in the CS realm have 
primarily revolved around mastering data structures and implementing algorithms to create functional user-friendly 
games and utilities. Please visit her <a href="../projects.html">projects</a> page to learn more about her previous
