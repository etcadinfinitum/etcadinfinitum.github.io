<h3>Engineering Mentor Night @ North Seattle College, March 1, 2018</h3>
<p>Mentor Night was great! I enjoyed meeting with enthusiastic members of the computing industry, both software engineers and hardware designers! It was nice to get a few 
contacts who were eager to field questions from me, and I walked away from the experience with more enthusiasm for the industry. I'm looking forward to my next mixer event, 
whether at North Seattle College in the next few months, or at University of Washington Bothell as a junior starting in Fall 2018.</p>
