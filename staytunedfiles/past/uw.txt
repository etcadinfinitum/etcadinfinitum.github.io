<h3>Application Deadlines for UW & Other Institutions Are Upon Us!</h3>
<p>The deadlines for applications to the University of Washington (Seattle & Bothell campuses) are approaching fast, and many 
hours have been spent trying to wring a great essay out of a blinking cursor. I am giddily anticipating the high quality of curriculum, 
opportunity for collaboration on research and capstone projects, and being in great company at a reputable institution. Thankfully, my excitement far outweighs 
the stress induced by wondering if I'll get admitted.
