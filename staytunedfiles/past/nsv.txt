<h3>Collaboration on Lantern application with No School Violence, beginning January 2018</h3>
<p>I am excited to be working with the volunteers and leaders behind the <a href="https://www.noschoolviolence.org/">No School Violence</a> campaign. 
We are working on building a web application for K-12 use cases, and part of the organization's mission is to harness the wealth of data on school violence 
and build better predictive models and intervention services for parents, educators, and health professionals. If you want to know more about the project, 
feel free to peruse the website or contact me directly.</p>
