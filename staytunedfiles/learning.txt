<h3>Explore machine learning concepts</h3>
<p>Lizzy wants to become familiar with AI and machine learning technologies. What better way to learn than by doing something silly and fun, 
like creating a visualizer application?</p>
<p>Tentative plan:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Implement a learning model to identify contiguous color segments of images or video feed</li>
    <li>Overlay contiguous segments with animations</li>
    <li>Package an application to perform mechanics using screen or camera input in real time?</li>
    <li>Other pipe dreams as desired</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Toolkit:<br />
<ul>
    <li>PyTorch</li>
</ul>
