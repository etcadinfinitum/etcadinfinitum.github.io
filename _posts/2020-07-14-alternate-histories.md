title: Education Will Save My Life
description: Reflections on the parallel universe in which I did not matriculate in 2016 and study computer science, and thoughts on what to do now as a human staring at a pandemic future.

In the past few weeks, I have been celebrating the rite of passage of 
higher education, but more importantly, I have been trying to project 
what my future would look like if I had not gone back to school in 2016. 
These musings mostly come to mind when I scan the headlines related to 
COVID-19, which has been especially poorly handled in the state of 
Texas, where I lived from 2009 to 2016.

## Pessimism

**The parallel universe I inhabit looks bleak at best and catastrophic 
at worst.**

Trading unemployment for high-risk essential worker positions which pay 
minimum wage. Trying to pay rent ($725 at my last Texas residence), 
buy groceries, and get gas for the car with 
unemployment benefits of $273[^1] per week, or $290[^2] per week if 
working. Watching the ruthlessly penny-pinched savings balance from 
better days ($15/hour) evaporate. Fitfully reaching for breathing 
techniques, YouTube yoga, anything to relieve the continuous crescendo 
from anxiety to panic. 

Grieving the transition from being housing-insecure 
to a new inevitability: homelessness.

For millions of people across the US, this is not a dystopic 
dream. **It is a true crisis, as inescapable as the labor culture 
that brought this reality to bear.** 

## Optimism

For folks in high technology, it is probably hard to appreciate the urgency 
of this situation, and I am beginning to understand why.

I start a new job in three weeks. I will be a software engineer at Google. 
I will make more money in the next four months than I have in the past 
two years. I will have health benefits, _excellent_ health benefits, for the 
first time in two years. Saving for retirement, or a down payment on 
a house, is no longer a dream; it is a goal.

## Humility

A few weeks ago, I met up with some friends to walk through SLU and 
catch up (masks on, 6 foot bubbles in attendance). K asked me about the new 
job, and I immediately started talking about savings goals, finally going 
to the dentist, relocation plans. Offhandedly, I said, "I realized a few 
days ago that I could save 100 grand in 4 years." T stared at me, and the 
ice bath of realization washed over me. 

My friend T, the artist and photographer with a wicked sense of humor, 
is suffering. They are one of the most vulnerable people in our circle 
of friends. They have not been able to work in months. They have 
channeled their time, creativity, and energy to shed light on BLM in Seattle 
because, as a POC, they have suffered racial profiling and police brutality 
their entire lives.

And I, a white woman of privilege and education, am immune to their 
problems.

My immunity will become a problem.

## Futures

I feel the fear and hopelessness that is pervasive. In the face of a 
global health crisis, we feel small and ineffective. But I believe, 
now more than ever, leveraging our own resources to protect each other 
is the responsible thing to do.

Donating:
* For Seattle residents, [start here](http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/covid-19#iwanttodonatevolunteer).
* For Austin residents, [start here](https://downtownaustin.com/blog/help/) or [here](https://www.givingcityaustin.com/volunteering/covid-19-list-of-ways-to-donate-to-help-austin-area-unemployed-health-care-workers-families-and-more/).
* For international health efforts, [start here](https://covid19responsefund.org/en/).

Obviously, this is not an inclusive list. If you cannot donate money, 
it is possible to donate time, blood, plasma, and food. Most importantly, 
we can all hold space for each other: provide an emotional refuge so 
that we all feel less alone and live a shared experience.

Last, but not least: wear a mask. Wash your hands.
