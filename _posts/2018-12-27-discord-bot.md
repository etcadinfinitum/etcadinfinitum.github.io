title: Image Modulation Discord Bot
description: I made a silly, nifty bot for Discord which uses ImageMagick bindings for Python.
---

My cohorts at UW Bothell use Discord frequently, and I got inspired to create a Discord bot that modulates images from users. 

The result of my work is the DeepPhryBot. Some example output is shown in the image gallery below.

It was really fun to put this into production and get feedback from users. I have some ideas to improve existing functionality and support user feedback on image modulation presets; I look forward to seeing this project grow.

The code is available [on Github](https://www.github.com/etcadinfinitum/DiscordDeepPhryer) is firmly in emergency maintenance mode. A public instance of the bot is [available for your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=521562757787811841&scope=bot&permissions=100416), and you can create your own instance as described in the [project's README](href="https://github.com/etcadinfinitum/DiscordDeepPhryer/blob/master/README.md).
