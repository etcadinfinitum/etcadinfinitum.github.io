title: Image Modulation Discord Bot
description: I made a silly, nifty bot for Discord which uses ImageMagick bindings for Python.
---

My cohorts at UW Bothell use Discord frequently, and I got inspired to create a Discord bot that modulates images from users. 

The result of my work is the DeepPhryBot. Some example output is shown in the image gallery below. 

{% include gallery.html folder="/public/images/phryer" %}

It was really fun to put this into production and get feedback from users. I have some ideas to improve existing functionality and support user feedback on image modulation presets; I look forward to seeing this project grow.

The code is available [on Github](https://www.github.com/etcadinfinitum/DiscordDeepPhryer) is firmly in emergency maintenance mode. A public instance of the bot is [available for your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=521562757787811841&scope=bot&permissions=100416), and you can create your own instance as described in the [project's README](href="https://github.com/etcadinfinitum/DiscordDeepPhryer/blob/master/README.md).
