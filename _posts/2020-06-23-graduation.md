I am pleased to announce that as of June 12th, I earned a **Bachelors of 
Science in Computer Science and Software Engineering** from University of 
Washington Bothell.

# Highlight Reels

## Academics

While sometimes stressful, I enjoyed living up to the challenge in UWB's 
CS program. Some of my favorite work is represented here, but almost all 
my projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/etcadinfinitum).

## Extracurriculars

The work I am most proud of was done for the 
[UWB ACM student chapter](https://uwbacm.com). I served as the Chief 
Technical Officer for the 2019-2020 year, and led many events and outreach 
efforts on behalf of the club and the larger CS program.

* My work for the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/UWB-ACM/CTCI) 
  workshop series made it into the 
  [school newspaper](https://www.uwb.edu/news/january-2019/computing-club) 
  and the event series continued to thrive in the 2019-2020 year.
* I helped create content for the club's 
  [2019 hackathon](https://uwbhacks.com/archive/2019/), and was the content 
  project manager for the [2020 hackathon](https://uwbhacks.com/), UWB 
  Hacks the Cloud.
* I also contributed in other notable, including leading the club's 
  quarterly `git` workshop, setting up and maintaining club infrastructure, 
  leading officer meetings when needed, and performing outreach with 
  [PuPPy](https://www.pspython.com/app/), UWB's 
  [Technical Advisory Board](https://www.uwb.edu/stem/about/advisory-board), 
  and other groups.

# Celebrating

My dad is very proud, and I am thrilled, even though we both look like 
weirdos in this particular photo.
